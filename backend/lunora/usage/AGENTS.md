# USAGE — AGENT NOTES

Scoped notes, moved from the root `AGENTS.md`: what is non-obvious and still true here. Paths are
repo-relative. Project-wide rules stay in the root `AGENTS.md`.

## INVARIANTS

- **Usage rollup** (`backend/lunora/usage/`) — the usage page's heatmap and
  per-skill breakdown read `usageDaily`, never messages. EVERY run path records
  through `usage/schedule.ts#scheduleReplyUsage` (afterRun, `runHeadlessAgent`,
  the Daily Brief) — a new run path that skips it is missing from the page.
  A reply is keyed on its FIRST reply row id in `usageReplies`, which both
  the live record and the one-shot backfill (`usage/backfill.ts`) check, so
  redelivery and backfill/live overlap count once; the backfill's reply
  grouping (`backfill-logic.ts#groupReplies`) must keep matching what one run
  saves, or its keys stop lining up with the live ones. Keys are pruned only
  after the user's backfill is done.
